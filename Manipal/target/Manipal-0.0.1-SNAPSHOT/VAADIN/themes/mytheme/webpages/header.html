					Schools need data to improve. But balancing the data, analysis and
					reporting requirements across a system of primary schools can be
					challenging. Edrix eases this burden by allowing anyone to perform
					sophisticated education analytics and share their findings with
					online dashboards. Edrix can also be a powerful research tool within
					the classroom, empowering students and teachers alike to see and
					understand their data through education dashboards.</p>
